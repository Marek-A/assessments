Shipments CRUD page:

Create an HTML Page with relevant Javascript to:

- Load shipments data with AJAX from https://my.api.mockaroo.com/shipments.json?key=5e0b62d0
(Note that that link might get overloaded, so you can also use off line version renaming shipment.txt file)
- Display data in generated table (see attachment ShipmentsTable.png as example) 
- Provide a button in the table to open a panel to visualize details of single row (see attachment ShipmentsDetails.png as example) 

TECH:
- You can implement it with vanilla javascript
- More points if you implement it with React

BENEFICIAL ADDITIONAL POINTS:
	
- Use one CSS template (for example get some from here: https://www.creative-tim.com/templates/free)
- Implement delete button on the table
- Implement update on Details panel (field values could be changed in the UI)
- Use Axios
- Use React + Redux
- Use React + Redux + Thunk middleware
